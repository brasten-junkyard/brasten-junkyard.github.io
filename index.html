            I've been coding for as long as I can remember.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the code I've written will sit on old hard drives until it was
            eventually lost forever. This would not be any great loss to society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, this pile of code represents a lot of my childhood and later personal
            and professional development. So for reasons that are purely selfish and/or sentimental,
            I'll be pushing some of it here over time.

                A BBS "door" game, similar to BRE or SRE. It has some critical flaws

            THIS CODE MIGHT ERASE YOUR COMPUTER. It might ruin your life. Most of it won't actually
            run, and any that does shouldn't. Seriously, don't run any of this.
